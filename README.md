## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

**You need to install Node.js first:**
- Download Node.js 18+ from https://nodejs.org
- Verify installation: `node --version` (should show v18 or higher)
- npm comes with Node.js automatically
- **Modern web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GRRRillaNinja/modern-dnd-labyrinth.git
   cd modern-dnd-labyrinth
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   # Install root dependencies
   npm install
   
   # Install client dependencies (React, Vite, etc.)
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   # (You should already be in the client folder from step 2)
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser:**
   - Visit `http://localhost:3000`
   - The game should load automatically!

**Note:** The game works fully without any additional setup. Leaderboards require a Supabase database - see **[SUPABASE_SETUP.md](SUPABASE_SETUP.md)** if you want to enable them (optional).

### Building for Production

```bash
cd client
npm run build
```

The production build will be in `client/dist/`

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Choose Your Quest**
   - Select Solo Quest (1 player) or Two Warriors (2 players)
   - Choose Level 1 (open passages) or Level 2 (locking doors)

2. **Pick Your Waystone**
   - Click a chamber to set your secret safe room
   - This is where you must return the treasure to win!

3. **Navigate the Labyrinth**
   - Click adjacent chambers to move your warrior
   - Discover walls by attempting to move through them
   - Watch your move count (shown in sidebar when dragon is awake)

4. **Find the Dragon's Treasure**
   - 🐉 Dragon wakes when you get within 3 tiles
   - ✨ Sparkles mark the treasure area (solo mode only)
   - 🏆 Pick up the treasure to win

5. **Return to Your Waystone**
   - Carry the treasure back to your starting Waystone
   - You're safe from the dragon on your own Waystone tile
   - Victory! 🎉

### Level 2 Tips
- 🚪 Some doors start locked, others unlocked
- 🔐 Try locked doors - you have a 50% chance to unlock them
- 🔒 Unlocked doors will lock behind you after you pass
- 🎯 Plan your route carefully!

## ⚙️ Customization

Edit `shared/types/index.ts` to adjust game settings:

```typescript
export const DEFAULT_SETTINGS: GameSettings = {
  maxLives: 3,                    // Lives per warrior
  baseMoves: 2,                   // Base moves per turn
  movesPerLife: 2,                // Additional moves per life
  movesWithTreasure: 4,           // Moves when carrying treasure
  treasureRoomDistance: 3,        // Min distance for treasure spawn
  dragonWakeDistance: 3,          // Distance dragon wakes at
  dragonVisibilityDistance: 5,    // Distance dragon visible (solo mode)
  doorClosedProb: 0.35,           // 35% chance door starts locked
};
```
